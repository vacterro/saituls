"""Pure decision engine for SAISPIN, the orphan CPU watchdog.

No Windows API, no process enumeration, no termination, no tray, no scheduler.
It answers exactly one question about data somebody else collected: given this
process's hot/cold history and the current sample, IGNORE, ALERT or KILL?

Keeping the answer here is the whole point. The rules below were written from
two real incidents and one counterexample, and every one of them is a rule
where being wrong is invisible until it kills the wrong process:

* one CPU spike is not evidence. Only a CONSECUTIVE hot streak counts, so a
  compiler that pegs a core for twenty seconds never registers;
* an orphan is not a kill target. The orphaned ``pytest`` processes that
  started this design were sleeping at ~0% CPU -- the majority case;
* a spinning process with a live parent is never killed automatically. It is
  usually a compiler, an encoder, an indexer or a test run doing its job;
* PID is not identity. PID + StartTime is, so a reused PID starts from zero
  instead of inheriting a dead process's strikes;
* missing or untrusted information biases toward NOT killing.

The engine is the same code the watcher runs and the tests exercise, so the
safety logic can be proven without spawning a single real spinning process:

    python tests/test_saispin.py

The watcher feeds it one JSON sweep per invocation on stdin and reads the
decisions plus the next state back out on stdout:

    ... | python Scripts/saispin_logic.py --sweep
